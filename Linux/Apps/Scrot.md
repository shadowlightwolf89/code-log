# Scrot

An advanced screenshot utility.

## Installation

Open terminal and type:


```
$ sudo apt-get install scrot
```

## Usage

To take a full screen snapshot with a delay of 5 seconds and save it to your Photos folder with the full date as it's title open terminal and type:

```
$ scrot -b -d 5 ~/Videos/%Y:%m:%d:%H:%M:%S.png
```

## Notes

Works well, I recommend the delay so you can minimize your terminal real quick.
